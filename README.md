# GCIX Tool - by OAleex

# Features

Extraction of data from GCIX files
Insertion of data into GCIX files

# Usage
Once you have run the GCIX Tool, you will be prompted to enter a file name. Provide the name of the file you want to work with.

Next, you will be presented with the following choices:
Extract datas: This option extracts data from the GCIX file. If the file contains a valid GCIX header, the tool will extract the information and save it as separate files in a folder with the same name as the input file (without the extension).

Insert datas: This option allows you to insert data into the GCIX file. If the file contains a valid GCIX header, the tool will look for corresponding dump files in a folder with the same name as the input file (without the extension). It will then insert the data from the dump files into the original file at the specified positions.
